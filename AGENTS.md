# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
This repository contains a Python library for schedule events and tasks using human-readable YAML files.
The library is designed to be flexible and simple to use, allowing users to easily create and manage their schedules.

## Restrictions
- NEVER TOUCH ANYTHING OUTSIDE THIS REPOSITORY. You are only allowed to read and modify files within this repository.

## Priorities
When working in this project, keep this order of importance:

1. Pythonic: Ensure readability, maintainability, reusability, and consistency.
2. Code: Prefer correct behavior over stylistic cleanup.
3. Test: Add or update tests for behavior changes.
4. Documentation: Keep user-facing and developer-facing documentation aligned with the code.
5. Format: Apply formatting and lint fixes after correctness is in place.

## Project structure
- Library code lives in `src/`
    - Modules and submodules are named with gerunds (e.g. `utilizing/`).
    - Class names use `CamelCase`.
    - Files defining a class use the same `CamelCase` name as the class and contain only that class by default.
    - Files with shared information only for the model use `_shared.py`.
    - Shared modules without a class use `snake_case` filenames.
    - Functions and methods use `snake_case`.
    - Protected functions and methods start with one leading underscore (`_`).
    - Private functions and methods start with two leading underscores (`__`).
- Tests live in `tests/`
    - Unittest follows same directory structure as `src/`.
    - Each method for each module have at least 2 sweet path tests, 1 edge case test and 1 error case test.
    - Integration tests are organized by feature or module in `tests/integration/`.
    - Human validation tests, such as visual outputs, live in `tests/manual/`.
- Documentation lives in `docs/`
    - Public API docs are generated from docstrings in `src/`.
    - User guides and other public-facing documentation are written in markdown in `docs/`.
    - The documentation will be hosted in ReadTheDocs.
- Design lives in `devs/`
    - `devs/` follows same directory structure as `src/` for design docs related to specific modules.
    - Design artifacts must reference the same naming convention used in `src/`, including `CamelCase` class files, `_shared.py`, and `snake_case` shared modules.
    - Internal text design docs live in markdown files called `.dsg`.
    - Class and sequence diagrams use plantuml.
    - Task files `.tsk` contain specific tasks to be done in module, class and function levels.
- Applications and runnables live in `apps/`
- User helpers live in `resources/`
- Configuration is defined in `pyproject.toml`
- CI workflows live in `.github/workflows/`

## General rules
Rules for code agents to follow. If a rule must be broken, ask for explicit permission:
- Preserve public behavior.
- Re-utilize existing code when possible.
- Follow good-practices for coding, including design patterns and conventions.
- Do not introduce new dependencies without approval.
- Prefer explicit, typed, readable code.
- Avoid refactors.
- Do not write absolute filesystem paths in repository files; use paths relative to the repository root.
- Keep a clean state between the implementation `/src` and the design `/devs` directories.

## New Feature Development policy
1. understand the affected public and internal interfaces
2. add design doc if the change is non-trivial
3. create directories, files and signatures before implementing logic
4. add or update tests first when practical
5. implement the minimal code required
6. run validation checks
7. update user-facing docs and changelog

## Agents policy
Agents skills are defined under .agents
