## Project structure

- `src/yasched/`: main source code for the project.
- `tests/`: test suite for the project.
- `docs/`: documentation for the project.
- `apps/`: example applications and demos using the project.

### Format conventions

#### Code

- Classes would use `PascalCase`.
- Functions and variables would use `snake_case`.
- Constants would use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`.

#### Tests

- Every class and function should have corresponding tests inside `tests` directory.
- Test directories must follow the same structure as the `src` directory.
- Apps, scripts or documentation do not require tests by default.
- Inside `tests`, a `manual` directory can be used for manual test scripts that require human interaction.

#### Files and directories

- Directories would use gerund `.ing` form.
- If a file contains a single class, it would be named after the class.
- If a file contains multiple classes or functions, it would be named after the main functionality it provides.
- Use single files for each class or closely related classes.

#### Python

- Use typing annotations for all function signatures.
- Use complete docstrings.
- Use max line, max file and complexity checks to maintain readability and simplicity.
